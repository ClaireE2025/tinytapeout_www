* Sylvain Munaut for help with scan chain improvements
* Mike Thompson for verification expertise
* Jix for formal verification support
* Proppy for help with GitHub actions
* Maximo Balestrini for all the amazing renders and the interactive GDS viewer
* James Rosenthal for coming up with digital design examples
* All the people who took part in TinyTapeout 01 and volunteered time to improve docs and test the flow
* YosysHQ and other open source tool makers
* Efabless for running the shuttles and providing OpenLane
* Tim Ansell and Google for supporting the open source silicon movement
* Zero to ASIC course community for all your support
