In this puzzle, you will figure out how to build a flip flop from basic logic gates.

What is a flip flop exactly? A [flip flop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)) is a circuit that can stably store one bit of information. In other words, its output will hold a 1 or 0 until both the *input* changes and *enable* goes to 1. 

Why are flip flops important? Well once you can stably store information, it becomes easier to develop modular, programmable circuits to measure, compute, and transmit information. A flip flop is thus a key building block in digital design, and one that is important to understand if, for example, you want to learn a [hardware description language  (HDL)](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/hdl/). 

For the puzzle, a basic flip flop has been created. However, someone has changed all the gates to OR gates and now the outputs are wrong! Using your [knowledge of logic gates and truth tables](/digital_design/logic_gates), **can you figure out which gate to use to fix the flip flop?**

Feel free to play around to try to figure it out. You can always return to the [logic gate tutorial](/digital_design/logic_gates) if you need a refresher.
