Still feeling uncertain about digital logic gates and how they function? You can use the same Wokwi interface to explore different gates at your own pace.  One exercise we like is to draw out the truth table for each gate that you’re unfamiliar with. 

Here’s one we built to help figure out the NAND gate. By toggling inputs 1 and 2 - you can find out what combination you need to turn the red LED on.

| input 1 | input 2 | output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0       | 1      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |
