# Testimonials

> Just made a 4-bit barrel shifter by using this http://tinytapeout.com toolkit. It's quick and fun to use. The GDS even generated within minutes. Everyone should try this.

> Thank you for doing it - I always wanted to join these OpenMPW shuttles, but never felt ready for it. TinyTapeout provided a way for me to get in, while only spending 2 evening of effort on my end. That's amazing!

> Just yesterday, I was dreaming of a tapeout cooperative, and it turns out to exist. Thanks to you all!! Looking forward to TT05!
