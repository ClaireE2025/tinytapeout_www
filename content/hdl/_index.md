For [TinyTapeout-01](/runs/tt01/), about 15% of TinyTapeout submissions were made with a [Hardware Description Language](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/hdl/), or HDL.

For TinyTapeout-02, we are expecting about 50% of submissions to be made with an HDL. To support you, we've started putting together some resources here.
