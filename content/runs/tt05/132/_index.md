| # | Input        | Output       | Bidirectional      |
|---|--------------|--------------| -------------------|
| 0 | compare bit 11  | segment a | second counter bit 0 |
| 1 | compare bit 12  | segment b | second counter bit 1 |
| 2 | compare bit 13  | segment c | second counter bit 2 |
| 3 | compare bit 14  | segment d | second counter bit 3 |
| 4 | compare bit 15  | segment e | second counter bit 4 |
| 5 | compare bit 16  | segment f | second counter bit 5 |
| 6 | compare bit 17  | segment g | second counter bit 6 |
| 7 | compare bit 18  | dot | second counter bit 7 |
