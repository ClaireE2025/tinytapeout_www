## 111 : 0b 001 101 111 : chase the beat

{{< tt-scanchain-switches "001101111" >}}

* Author: Emil J Tywoniak
* Description: Tap twice to the beat, the outputs will chase the beat. Or generate some audio noise!
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ekliptik/tt02-chase-the-beat)
* HDL project
* [Extra docs]()
* Clock: 1000 Hz
* External hardware: A button on the tap input, a switch on the mode input, LEDs on the 8 outputs, and audio output on the first output. Don't just connect headphones or speakers directly! It could fry the circuit, you need some sort of amplifier.



### How it works

The second button press sets a ceiling value for the 1kHz counter. When the counter hits that value, it barrel-shifts the outputs by one bit. When the mode pin isn't asserted, the first output pin emits digital noise generated by a LFSR

### How to test

Set 1kHz clock on first input. After reset, set mode to 1, tap the tap button twice within one second. The outputs should set to the beat

### IO

| # | Input        | Output       |
|---|--------------|--------------|
| 0 | clk  | o_0 - LED or noise output |
| 1 | rst  | o_1 - LED |
| 2 | tap  | o_2 - LED |
| 3 | mode  | o_3 - LED |
| 4 | none  | o_4 - LED |
| 5 | none  | o_5 - LED |
| 6 | none  | o_6 - LED |
| 7 | none  | o_7 - LED |
