### How it works

On write enable, the four data-inputs are saved to the d-flipflops selected by the address inputs. The output is always read from the current selected flipflops.


### How to test

Connect a clock, buttons for reset and switches for address and data like shown below. The output can be read by using 4 LEDs or any other kind of binary output device.


### IO

| # | Input        | Output       |
|---|--------------|--------------|
| 0 | clock  | data1 |
| 1 | reset  | data2 |
| 2 | addr1  | data3 |
| 3 | addr2  | data4 |
| 4 | data1  | none |
| 5 | data2  | none |
| 6 | data3  | none |
| 7 | data4  | none |
