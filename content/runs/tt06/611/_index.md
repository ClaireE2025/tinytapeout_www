### How it works

The project consists of a state machine with 4 outputs, which is used to control a bipolar stepper motor.

### How to test

The system has an external clock input, a reset input, a control input for selecting the direction of rotation of the motor, an enable input and 4 outputs for the stepper motor coils.

### External hardware

The system requires an external clock input to control the speed of the pulses and thus regulate the rotation speed of the motor.
