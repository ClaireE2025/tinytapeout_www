### How it works

The function of this project is to enable the user to determine accurate even or odd numbers.  No matter which number (1-8) the user turns on, the LED bulbs will not light evenly. Using dip switch 8 user can choose which number will be used and according to logicgates(AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOT) LED and 7seg dipslay will work.

### How to test

To get even/odd numbers you have to switch on 2,4,6 and 8 (2,4,6,8 ->„1“ and 1,3,5,7 ->„0“ ). All blue led bulbs should light and 8 have to be displayed.
