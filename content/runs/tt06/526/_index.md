### How it works

It is a set of inverters each with their own input and output pins.

### How to test

Choose an inverter and find the pinout for it in the info.yaml file. The apply your input and measure the output.

### External hardware

Something to generate signals. This could be the TT06 printed circuit board or an expensive signal generator.
