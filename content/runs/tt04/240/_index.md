### How it works

"Takes 2 numbers and adds them using binary code with logic gates"


### How to test

"Selecting the different switches and switching them on and off to turn on the leds, each switch has an assigned value, such as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16"


### IO

| 1 | none  | segment b | none |
| 2 | none  | segment c | none |
| 3 | none  | segment d | none |
| 4 | none  | segment e | none |
| 5 | none  | segment f | none |
| 6 | none  | segment g | none |
| 7 | none  | dot | none |
