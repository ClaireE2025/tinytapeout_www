This is a simple 8bits counter. This was generated automatically by an Edge AI. Its EdgeAI environment is that of https://github.com/noritsuna/Edge_Circuit_Designer .


### How to test

Check reset, ena, counter function.


### IO

| # | Input        | Output       | Bidirectional      |

| 0 | none  | counter bit 0 | none |
| 1 | none  | counter bit 1 | none |
| 2 | none  | counter bit 2 | none |
| 3 | none  | counter bit 3 | none |
| 4 | none  | counter bit 4 | none |
| 5 | none  | counter bit 5 | none |
| 6 | none  | counter bit 6 | none |
| 7 | none  | counter bit 7 | none |
