An educational chip development workflow entirely in-browser, 
from graphic entry to GDSII output for #sky130! Stunning work by 
@matthewvenn to make an opaque area of technology accessible.

---
Last week I designed an integrated circuit for #tinytapeout, my first digital circuit design not to include any kind of cpu.

---
I still can't get over how smooth the ASIC design workflow of the #tinytapeout is 

---
Thank you @matthewvenn and everyone who made #tinytapeout happen! I made a simple counter FSM based on a UTexas presentation (linked below), but I made it all on my new Steamdeck!

---
Created a 128-Bit Memory (8 x 16-Bit Blocks) custom ASIC. I hope it will be manufactured in next shuttle run.
Aside from that, It was amazing how seamless and easy was the whole process.
