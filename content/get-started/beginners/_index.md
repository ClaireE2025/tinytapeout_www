Welcome to the fasinatng world of semicondutor design. We are excited to have you here.

Here is a list of resources to get you started:

1. [Digital Design with Wokwi](https://tinytapeout.com/digital_design/) - Learn about logic gates, flip-flops, and more with our web-based, interactive design tool. We've seen students go through the tutorial and create their first digital design in just one evening (but it's okay to take your time - don't rush, enjoy the process).
2. [Learn how to submit your design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCGPKdmM3Dc)

Optional resources:

- [How do Semiconductors Work](https://tinytapeout.com/siliwiz/) - Not mandatory, but it will help you understand how the logic gates you design in Wokwi are implemented in silicon.
- [Making ASICs](https://tinytapeout.com/making_asics/) - a brief overview of how we use the open source tools inside a GitHub action to prepare your design for manufacturing.
