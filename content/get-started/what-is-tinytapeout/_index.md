Tiny Tapeout helps you create, manufacture, and share your own custom chips (ASICs). For the first time, makers, students, and small companies can create their own chips without breaking the bank, signing NDAs, and needing a PhD in semiconductor design (but if you have one, that's cool too).

You can get your design made for at little as $150, using open source tools and a community of experts to help you along the way. We're here to help you get started, and to make sure you have the resources you need to make a successful tapeout.

Depending on your experience, here is how to get started:

- [I'm new to ASIC design](../beginners/)
- [I know Verilog or another HDL](../verilog-and-hdl-users/)
- [I'm a teacher](../teachers/)
- [I'm an analog designer](../analog-designers/)

We also invite you to join our [Discord community chat](/discord), with a vibrant designer community of over 1,000 members.
