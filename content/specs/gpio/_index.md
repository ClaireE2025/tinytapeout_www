### GPIO pins

There are total of 26 I/O pins available for your design:

| Name          | Count | Direction | Description            |
|---------------|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| `clk`         | 1     | Input     | Clock input            |
| `rst_n`       | 1     | Input     | Active low reset       |
| `ui_in[7:0]`  | 8     | Input     | General purpose input  |
| `uo_out[7:0]` | 8     | Output    | General purpose output |
| `uio[7:0]`    | 8     | Bidir     | General purpose I/O    |

Internally, both the `clk` and `rst_n` pins are handled like any other input pins. However, they have special meaning to the [Tiny Tapeout demo board](../pcb). For more information on the `clk` pin and input synchronization, see the [Clock](../clock) section.

### Limitations

The caravel chip uses the [sky130_ef_io_gpiov2_pad](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/contents/libraries/sky130_fd_io/docs/user_guide.html#sky130-fd-io-gpiov2-additional-features) macro for the I/O pads. The documentation lists the following limitations:

| Parameter                    | Limitation   |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Maximum output frequency     | 33 MHz       |
| Maximum input frequency      | 66 MHz       |
| Drive strength (source/sink) | 4 mA         |
| IO suppply voltage \*        | 1.71V - 5.5V |

\* The demo board provides 3.3V IO supply voltage. The input pins are not 5V tolerant.
